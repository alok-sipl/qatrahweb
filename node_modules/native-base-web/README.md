[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/native-base-web.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/native-base-web)

NativeBase-web is a project to bring [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) components to the Web, with the help of [react-native-web-extended](https://github.com/Chion82/react-native-web-extended).

Docs & Demo
--------------------
[NativeBase for Web Gitbook](https://chion82.gitbooks.io/nativebase-for-web/content/)

[Live demo here! Browse it on your iPhone6+/Android4.4.4+ devices.](https://blog.chionlab.moe/native-base-web-example/)

Compatibility
-------------
Currently supports Safari on iPhone6 or newer with IOS9/10, Android Browser on Android4.4.4 or newer, Chrome/Safari on both mobile and desktop.  

native-base-web(-extended) and native-base-web are both under development, so compatibility and performance problems may occur. We are working on resolving these issues.

Quick Start
-----------
It's advised to use [our boilerplate](https://github.com/Chion82/rnweb-native-base-starter) to initialize your app structure.

Manual Setup
------------
To install:

```
npm install --save native-base-web
```

NativeBase-web is depended on react-native-web-extended, an extended version of [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). Install it if you have not yet configured your app structure:

```
npm install --save react-native-web-extended
```

Setup resolve alias in your webpack configuration:

```JavaScript
resolve: {
	alias: {
		'react-native': 'react-native-web-extended',
		'native-base' : 'native-base-web'
	}
}
```
